# StochasticDAbids
The StochasticDAbids repository contains a stochastic MILP optimization algorithm for bidding in the DA wholesale energy and Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) markets. It considers the stochastic variability of PV and the possibility of bidding in the ID markets as well as shifting flexible loads (e.g. EV charging).
